		<p>I am an interdisciplinary artist and designer that fuese illustrations and digital art into one project. I am interested in using illustration as a nostalgic mode of medium, juxtaposed with graphic art. The topics that I have chosen to study in my projects mostly deal with common Westernized issues. I also love observing natural objects in natural, mundane states, so I tend to paint a lot of still life and traditional painting scenes. In terms of graphic design, I am intersted in branding and identity. Although I mostly work as a graphic designer, I have a fine art background, specifically in painting. Because of my deeply rooted interested in painting and drawing, I enjoy incorporating fine art values and aesthetics into graphic design.
