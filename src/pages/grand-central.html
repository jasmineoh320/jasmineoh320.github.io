              <h1>Grand Central Market Brand Book</h1>
              <p class="the-content" >
              This is a project where I branded a space using just aesthetics and design. The Grand Central Market is definitely one of the hidden gems of Los Angeles, showcased as an urban emporium that provides food, company, and warmth since 1917. The Grand Central Market was a place in the city to buy produce, but now it has become a metropolitan phenomenon that gathers all the hipsters and downtown liberals to sit down and sip coffee, eat delicious food, and explore the different kind of spices and herbs that can’t be find elsewhere. The Grand Central Market is so old yet stayed old, you can still find menus and signs that haven’t been changed by the decades.</p> 
              <p>The overarching feeling that I am trying to communicate about this place is its authenticity through its fixed position. While the rest of Downtown Los Angeles became urbanized with sleek skyscrapers and modern buildings, Grand Central Market managed to stay just as it was when it was first built. In my brand book, I’m trying to communicate the amalgamation of history and presence, what was then and what is now, to really depict how much history the place itself carries through its consistent and unchanged space. And I’m communicating this narrative by making collages to really delineate the space. Collaging is a method that appear quick, imperfect, flat, yet strikingly beautiful, which I believe delineates the Grand Central Market very well. Also, by putting vintage photos and contemporary photos side by side, it communicates a very direct and distinct feeling about the space that I am depicting in my book. Furthermore, I am adding texture to the spreads because I feel like that’s an important part about Grand Central Market that really speaks about its endurance throughout history. </p>
